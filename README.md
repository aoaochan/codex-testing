# Codex Testing

This repository includes a simple WebSocket server and client written in Node.js.

## Usage

Install dependencies (requires internet access):

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the server

```bash
npm run start-server
```

### Start the client

In another terminal run:

```bash
npm run start-client
```

The client will connect to the server, send a message, and print the server's response.
